In a faraway land, 
there was a rooster who lived with his master and the wife. Every early morning,
the rooster would make a very loud sound. This shocked his master and
the wife so much that they jumped up from their sleep. 







One day,
the rooster heard that his master and the wife wanted to slaughter him for dinner.
He was afraid. He wanted to run away. But before he went off, he quickly took one of the wife’s shoes and the master’s fiddling stick. Then he ran off into the forest feeling happy and satisfied. 

 Moral of The Story : 

Always be careful of someone that you know. Because sometimes they have bad ideas towards you.
